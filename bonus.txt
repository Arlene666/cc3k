1. Did not explicitly manage memory. All heap allocated objects are controlled
    using smart pointers and vectors.
2. Implemented intelligence to the enemies.
    Enable: Type 'l' during the game. Player will be asked to enter integer
            from 1 to 4. The default value is 1.
    Info:   The integer represents the the blocks of radius within which enemies can notice
            the PC. When enemies notice the PC, they move towards PC and
            attack the PC when the PC is in 1 block radius of the enemy.
            Enemies move randomly as usual when PC is out of the range.
            Enemies will avoid objects (gold and potion) while chasing the PC.
            However if enemy cannot chase the PC (when PC is in the corridor or
            more than three objects lined as a wall between PC and enemy) then
            enemy will stay still and wait for moving.
